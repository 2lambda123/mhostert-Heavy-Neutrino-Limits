## Collection of limits on Heavy Neutral Leptons

### List of constraints

All limits are kept track in this [Google Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1p_fslIlThKMOThGl4leporUsogq9TmgXwILntUZOscg/edit?usp=sharing).

**std_plots** makes the standard plots of constraints against the HNL mass for single flavor dominance scenario.

**inv_plots** makes plots with only constraints that apply on a HNL that decays invisibly.
