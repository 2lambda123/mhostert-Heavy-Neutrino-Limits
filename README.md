## Collection of limits on Heavy Neutral Leptons

---
### List of constraints

All limits are kept track in this [Google Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1p_fslIlThKMOThGl4leporUsogq9TmgXwILntUZOscg/edit?usp=sharing).

For a list of references, see the [auto-generated LaTeX files](https://github.com/mhostert/LimitsHNL/blob/main/pylatex/)

To add new limits, please send a pull-request adding your data to data/NAME_OF_YOUR_DIR/ and add a comment to the [Google spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1p_fslIlThKMOThGl4leporUsogq9TmgXwILntUZOscg/edit?usp=sharing) with the respective entries.

**std_plots** makes the standard plots of constraints against the HNL mass for single flavor dominance scenario.

**inv_plots** makes plots with only constraints that apply on a HNL that decays invisibly.
